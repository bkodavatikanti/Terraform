loops:

iterate through list,map
for (expression) {

for (int i=0; i<20 ; i++){
    print i
}
}

locals:

locals are almost variables but a simple difference is it can run some expressions and functions inside it. you can save intermediate values in locals and use it wherever you require.

ex: if you want to join two variables then we can go for locals.
